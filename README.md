## Project Description

Moodify is a user-friendly Android app built in order to help friends and family keep track and share their moods throughout the day. By posting their many detailed mood events that include photos, descriptions, geolocation tags, and more, users can explore the emotional adventures of themselves and their loved ones, all the while creating a supportive community of Moodify-ers
## Key Features

- ALL USER STORIES
- Mood Event Posting – Create mood events with a required emotional state and optional trigger or social context. Also, every entry is timestamped.
- Public & Private Sharing – Choose between posting mood events publicly for  visibility or privately for personal reasons.
- User Profile Management – Maintain unique user profiles with searchable usernames and personal details.
- Mood History Feed – View your personal mood history in a reverse chronological list.
- Following & Friend Requests – Follow other users by sending requests and manage incoming requests by accepting or denying friend requests.

- Advanced Filtering & Search – Filter mood events by date, emotional state, or keywords to quickly find what you're looking for.
- Geolocation Integration – Optionally attach your current location to mood events and view them on interactive maps. Friends can also view your location.
- Offline Functionality – Add, edit, or delete mood events even when offline, with changes syncing automatically when connectivity is restored.
- Multimedia Attachments – Enhance mood events with photographs (with file size constraints) for a better storytelling experience.
